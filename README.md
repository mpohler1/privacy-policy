This privacy policy applies to <www.masonpohler.com> and is effective June 24th, 2020.

This privacy policy does not apply to the projects hosted on <www.masonpohler.com>. Each project has its own privacy policy. For example, the project PC Wonder hosted at <www.masonpohler.com/pc-wonder-app> has its privacy policy located at <www.masonpohler.com/pc-wonder-app/#/privacy-policy>.

This site does not share user information with any other organization.

This site does not use cookies or databases to store or track information about users. This site's behavior will not change when a "Do Not Track" request is sent, since this site already does not track its users.

This site has a "contact me" feature that sends automated email on the user's behalf to Mason Pohler at the email address <dev@masonpohler.com> using the automated email account <automated@masonpohler.com>. In order to use this feature, the user's name and email address is asked for. This information is included in the automatic email. The information is used for Mason Pohler to contact the user. The information serves no other purpose, and it is not used for any other purpose. Mason Pohler may not necessarily contact every user that uses this feature.

The "contact me" feature also includes a message body form field. Anything entered within this field will be included as part of the body of the automatic email sent to <dev@masonpohler.com>.

Users are not obligated to use the "contact me" feature, which means users are not obligated to provide their name or email address. If this information is not provided, then the "contact me" feature will simply not send an email. The email address <dev@masonpohler.com> is provided to the user so that they have the option of emailing Mason Pohler directly in the event that the user does not wish to use the "contact me" feature.

If a user uses the "contact me" feature and includes incorrect information, they are welcome to send another email to <dev@masonpohler.com> to amend it. Using the "contact me" feature with the correct information is another option.

This privacy policy may be updated in the future. If this privacy policy is updated, users will be informed on this site.

If you still have any questions or concerns about how your data is used, please contact Mason Pohler by email at <dev@masonpohler.com>
